## Documenting implemented rule
The rules implemented in the CLI are from Masse's book [1]. Additional informations about this rule are from Kotstein and Bogner [2]. Rules were selected by importance (categorization by Delphi study) --> first, implementation of high importance, ... Then add rule properties (difficulty of implementation, severity, software quality attributes , etc.)
* **Category** of the rule (from Kotstein and Bogner [2])
* Rules are categorized into three categories regarding **difficulty of implementation**: *easy, medium, and difficult*. 
* **Software quality attributes** linked to rules are from Kotstein and Bogner. Quality attributes are: *functional suitability, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, reliability, maintainability and portability*. 
* Categorize the rules according to the **severity**: *Warning* (may be), *Error* (should be), and *Critical* (must be). The severity indicates the urgency of a violation to be fixed. Naming conventions were inspired by IBM [3]. The tag *Critical* is derived from Massé's definition of the rule, in which *"must be"* is used as a phrase. It means that there is a critical condition with this violation and must be fixed immediately. An *Error* is assigned if *"should be"* is used as a phrase in the rule definition and means that there is an error condition with the violation, which should be removed. Lastly, the tag *Warning* is used when *"may be"* is used as a phrase and indicates a possible problem that may be fixed sooner or later.
* Add **implementation details** (_what is checked, what is not checked, future implementations_)

Template for the rules is in the file `./rule-template.md`

## Implemented rules

### Background information
Many of the rules implemented work with a part of the URI segment for an HTTP request.
URI stands for **U**niform **R**esource **I**dentifier and is a sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource. According to RFC 3986 [4] a URI has following structure:

*URI: scheme "://" authority "/" path [ "?" query ] [ "\#" fragment ]* 

A possible example of a valid URI, following above structure would be:

*https://example.com:8080/shelter/animals?name=cat\#rescue*

with *"https"* being the scheme, *"example.com:8080"* the authority, *"shelter/animals"* the path, *"?name=cat"* the query, and *"\#rescue"* the fragment.

For the implementation of rules related to the URI, we work on the *"path"*-portion of the URI. In an OpenAPI definition of an API, the path portion can be found in the *"paths"*-segment. Each path in the *"paths"* segment may optionally contain a list of parameter definitions for both path variables as also query parameters next to the required definition of the path. It may also contain request bodies and response definitions for numerous HTTP response codes. In these responses, a detailed description of what kind of response object, such as their data type, will be received for each HTTP response code.

### Rule implementation and extension
For each rule, a single Java class is created, which can be found in in this [dir](../../src/main/java/cli/rule/rules). It is just as easy to implement a new rule. For implementing a new rule, it is merely necessary to create a Java class in the folder just mentioned, which implements the [`IRestRule`](../../src/main/java/cli/rule/IRestRule.java) interface. Then, a constructor with an `isActive` boolean is needed. Now the rule is automatically recognized and listed in the CLI. This is the minimum that needs to be done to implement a new rule. 

For a better user experience, the progress bar can be called from the [output class](../../src/main/java/cli/utility/Output.java).
